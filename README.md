# 🎵 Spotify-UI-Clone Website
This repository contains a front-page UI clone of Spotify’s website, built entirely in HTML and CSS.  
It is a mini-project created as part of my web development learning journey, inspired by a video shared by my college. With their guidance, I built part of the structure, and independently developed the rest — without using any AI tools.

## ⚙️ Key Features of Website:-

🔹 **UI Design:** Clean and structured layout inspired by Spotify’s official site

🔹 **Pure HTML & CSS:** No frameworks, no JavaScript, no AI assistance

🔹 **Responsive Basics:** Designed to adapt across different screen sizes

🔹 **Learning Outcome:** Strengthened fundamentals in layout, styling, and design thinking

## 💻 Technologies Used:-

• **HTML** – Establishes the structural framework and organizes content logically.

• **CSS** – Enhances visual presentation, manages layout responsiveness, and applies design aesthetics.
