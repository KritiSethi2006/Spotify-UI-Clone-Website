# 🎵 Spotify-UI-Clone
This repository contains a front page UI clone of Spotify’s website**, built entirely with HTML and CSS.  
It is a mini-project created as part of my learning journey in web development, inspired by a video shared by my college. With their guidance, I built part of the structure, and independently developed the rest — without using any AI tools.

## ⚙️ Features
- 🎨 **UI Design:** Clean and structured layout inspired by Spotify’s official site
- 🖥️ **Pure HTML & CSS:** No frameworks, no JavaScript, no AI assistance
- 📱 **Responsive Basics:** Designed to adapt across different screen sizes
- 🧩 **Learning Outcome:** Strengthened fundamentals in layout, styling, and design thinking

## 📍 Learning Experience
This project helped me:
- Identify my current strengths in HTML & CSS
- Understand areas where I need to focus more
- Gain confidence in building UI from scratch
- Appreciate the importance of combining guidance with independent effort
